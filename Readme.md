# 🛠️ Challenge 3 — Fix the HTML Page

The file **`index.html`** contains several HTML structural issues.  
Some tags are **missing**, others are **incorrectly closed**, and a few elements are **not nested properly**.

Your task is to inspect the HTML carefully, identify the mistakes, and correct them.

---

## 🔍 What you need to do

1. Open `index.html`  
2. Look for:
   - tags that don’t close
   - tags that close with the wrong name
   - elements that appear to break the layout structure
   - sections that end earlier or later than expected  
3. Fix those issues so the page becomes a valid, well-formed HTML document.

The errors will not break the page completely, but they **do** affect the internal DOM structure.  
Your job is to restore clean and correct markup.

## 🌿 Git Workflow

Once you’ve fixed the file:

1. Fork repo into your account by clicking `fork` button in top right of the repo
2. Clone into your machine by using the command `git clone https://github.com/SketchBrains/Git-and-GitHub-Challenge-3`
3. Create a new branch  
4. Commit your corrections  
5. Push the branch to the repository  
6. Open a Pull Request  
7. Merge it back into the main branch
