Mission Log — Entry 47  
Commander Rhea Solis stood inside the observation dome of the Helion Station,
watching the pale blue nebula swirl outside. The energy waves had been growing
stronger each hour, and the station’s sensors were struggling to keep up.

Rhea activated the core console, but the interface flickered. A segment of the
primary log file was gone. Half the entry was missing, as if wiped remotely.
Only one line remained intact from the corrupted part:

“The source of the anomaly can only be understood ..if the data is reunited.  
The anomaly pulses in patterns that suggest intelligence —  
almost as if it senses when it is being watched.  

This final fragment was separated to prevent an accidental trigger.  
Once restored, Helion Station's core systems will unlock the true nature  
of the signal we've been tracking."
